# Circular-Double-Ended-Queues




In this circular double-ended queue project, various functions are implemented such as finding elements at the front or back, growing or shrinking the queue, and enqueueing and dequeueing operations. The project also includes a final function designed for Starbucks employees who are paid based on a day's revenue rather than hourly wages. The algorithm aims to optimize their work schedule within a given time period and work interval (k days) to maximize profits. By strategically selecting the days to work, particularly focusing on the first and last days of a pay period, the algorithm ensures that the employee is present on days when the shop's profits are at their peak, thus allowing them to thrive in an environment where revenue fluctuates frequently due to the building's location challenges.
